# assisi-video-analyser
Tool to analyse a video of bees.

These videos were done in the context of the ASSISIbf project.  Bees are placed in an arena with CASUs.  The CASUs are able to produce vibration, use airflow or do nothing.

This tool was developed to test different algorithms to process the frames of the video to extract features such as number of bees and bee speed per region of interest.
